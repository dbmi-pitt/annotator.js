        The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his
        neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings
        from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches
        ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased
        scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars
        were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.

        They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old
        man and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him
        and were sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the
        current and the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady
        good weather and of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that
        day were already in and had butchered their marlin out and carried them
        laid full length across two planks, with two men staggering at the end
        of each plank, to the fish house where they waited for the ice truck to
        carry them to the market in Havana. Those who had caught sharks had
        taken them to the shark factory on the other side of the cove where they
        were hoisted on a block and tackle, their livers removed, their fins cut
        off and their hides skinned out and their flesh cut into strips for
        salting.

        When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the
        shark factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour
        because the wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it
        was pleasant and sunny on the Terrace.
